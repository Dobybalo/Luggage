Optimalisation exercise, using the FFD algorithm.

We are given a fixed size 2d container and an amount of 2d boxes(rectangles), the task is to place as many boxes in the container as possible. For this, we have to either examine a large amount of box placements and choose the best among them, or use an algorithm such as the FFD(First Fit Decreasing) to find a suboptimal, but "good enough" way to place the boxes. In my implementation, I do the latter.
